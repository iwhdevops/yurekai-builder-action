# Create Builder YurekAI App

The easiest way to get started with Builder YurekAI for a new code base is with `create-builder-app`. Under the hood, we'll use `create-next-app`, `create-gatsby`, or `create-react-app` to help create a new app, and set it up with Builder YurekAI.

## Quickstart

```bash
npx create-builder-app
```
